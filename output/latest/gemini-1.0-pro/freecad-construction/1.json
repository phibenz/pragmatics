Then, select the \"Circle\" tool.\n\n3. **Draw the circle:** Click and drag on the sketch plane to draw a circle. The circle will be created as a Construction Geometry object.\n\n4. **Hide the circle:** By default, the Construction Geometry circle will be visible in the sketch. To hide it, select the circle and press the \"H\" key on your keyboard.\n\n5. **Use the circle for reference:** The hidden Construction Geometry circle will still be available as a reference for aligning other lines or objects in the sketch. For example, you can use the circle's center point or its circumference to position other elements precisely.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* Construction Geometry objects are not parametric, meaning they cannot be modified directly.
