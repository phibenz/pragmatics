Here's how to do it:\n\n1. **Create a Sketch:** Start by creating a new sketch on the desired plane.\n\n2. **Draw a Circle:** Use the \"Circle\" tool from the toolbar to draw a circle at the desired location and size.\n\n3. **Toggle to Construction Mode:** Right-click on the circle and select \"Toggle Construction.\" This will change the line style of the circle to dashed, indicating that it is a construction element.\n\n4. **Hide the Circle (Optional):** If you want to hide the circle from the model view, select it and press the \"H\" key to hide it. Hidden construction elements remain visible in the sketch but are not displayed in the 3D model.\n\n5. **Use the Circle for Reference:** You can now use the circle as a reference to align other lines or shapes in the sketch. For example, you can draw lines tangent to the circle or create polygons that are inscribed or circumscribed around it.\n\n6. **Exit Sketch:** Once you have finished using the circle for reference, exit the sketch by clicking on the \"Close\" button in the toolbar.\n\nRemember that construction elements are only visible in the sketch where they were created.
