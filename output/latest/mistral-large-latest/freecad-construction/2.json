Here's how you can create a reference circle to help you draw a hexagon:\n\n1. Switch to the Draft Workbench if you're not already in it. You can do this by clicking on \"Draft\" in the workbench menu.\n\n2. Create a new construction geometry layer:\n   - Click on the \"Layers\" icon in the toolbar or go to View -> Panels -> Layers to open the Layers panel.\n   - Click on the \"+\" button at the bottom of the Layers panel to create a new layer.\n   - Double-click on the new layer's name and rename it to something like \"Construction\".\n   - Make sure the \"Construction\" layer is selected, then click on the \"Toggle construction\" icon (looks like a gear) in the Layers panel to set it as a construction layer.\n\n3. Now, you can create a reference circle:\n   - Click on the \"Circle\" tool in the Draft toolbar or go to Draft -> Circle.\n   - You'll be prompted to select a center point and a radius for your circle. Choose appropriate values based on your design.\n   - Once the circle is created, it will appear as a dashed line, indicating that it's a construction geometry.\n\n4. Use the reference circle to draw your hexagon using the Draft Line tool:\n   - Click on the \"Line\" tool in the Draft toolbar or go to Draft -> Line.\n   - Use the circle as a guide to create the vertices of the hexagon by clicking at the desired points along the circle's circumference.\n   - After drawing each line segment, the line tool will remain active, allowing you to continue drawing additional segments.\n   - Once you've drawn all six sides of the hexagon, right-click or press Esc to exit the Line tool.\n\n5. If you want to hide the reference circle, you can do so in the Layers panel:\n   - Click on the \"Layers\" icon in the toolbar to open the Layers panel if it's not already open.\n   - Click on the eye icon next to the \"Construction\" layer to hide it, which will also hide the reference circle.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use a reference circle to create a hexagon or any other shape you need in FreeCAD. The construction geometry layer allows you to keep your reference shapes separate from your final geometry.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "mistral-large-latest", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
