You can find it in the toolbar at the top or by using the dropdown menu on the left side of the interface.\n3. Click on the \"Construction\" toolbar button or select \"Draft \u2192 Toggle Construction Mode\" from the menu to enable construction geometry mode. The button looks like a blue triangle with white dashed lines. When enabled, the button will appear pressed down.\n4. Now you can create a reference circle. Use the \"Draft \u2192 Circle\" command or click the \"Circle\" button in the toolbar.\n5. Specify the center and radius of the circle or use other available methods to define it, like selecting two opposite points to define the diameter.\n6. After creating the circle, you can use it as a reference to draw lines tangent to the circle or use other drafting tools to create your hexagon.\n7.

The reference circle will appear faded, indicating that it will not be part of the final model.\n\nRemember to switch back to the regular geometry mode (non-construction mode) before creating shapes that should be part of your final model.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a reference circle in FreeCAD and use it to align other lines to make a hexagon or any other shape you desire.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "mistral-large-latest", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
