Overmixing the Batter: If you stirred the batter until it was completely smooth, this might be the issue. Overmixing can lead to tough, rubbery pancakes. The batter should be lumpy; it's okay if there are still some small clumps of flour.\n\n2. Wrong Heat Level: If the heat was too high, the outsides of the pancakes might have cooked too quickly, causing them to burn before the insides were fully cooked. Conversely, if the heat was too low, the pancakes might not have risen properly and could have turned out dense and tough.\n\n3. Old Baking Powder or Baking Soda: If your pancakes were flat and didn't rise, it could be because your baking powder or baking soda (if your recipe included it) is old and has lost its effectiveness.\n\n4. Not Letting the Batter Rest: Allowing the batter to rest for a few minutes before cooking can help the pancakes be more tender.\n\n5. Using the Wrong Type of Flour: Different types of flour have different protein contents, which can affect the texture of the pancakes. For example, bread flour has a higher protein content than all-purpose flour, which could make the pancakes tough.\n\nWithout more specific information about what was \"terrible\" about your pancakes, it's hard to say for certain what the issue was.
