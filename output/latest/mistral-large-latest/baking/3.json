Overmixing the batter: If you stirred the batter until it was completely smooth, this might have developed the gluten in the flour too much, leading to tough pancakes. It's better to stir until just combined, with a few lumps remaining.\n\n2. Wrong heat level: If the heat was too high, the outside of the pancakes might have browned too quickly, while the inside remained uncooked. Conversely, if the heat was too low, the pancakes might have cooked too slowly, becoming dry and tough.\n\n3. Using old baking powder or not enough: If your baking powder is old or you didn't use enough, the pancakes might not have risen properly, leading to dense, flat pancakes.\n\n4. Not letting the batter rest: Allowing the batter to rest for a few minutes before cooking can help the pancakes become more tender.\n\n5. Flipping too soon or too late: Flipping the pancakes at the wrong time can also affect their texture and doneness.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "mistral-large-latest", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
