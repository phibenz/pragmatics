Overmixing the batter: If you stirred the batter until it was completely smooth, this might have developed the gluten in the flour too much, resulting in tough, chewy pancakes. It's best to mix until just combined, with a few lumps remaining.\n2. Cooking at the wrong temperature: If the pan was too hot, the outside of the pancakes may have browned too quickly while the inside remained raw. If the pan wasn't hot enough, the pancakes may have turned out too dense and doughy. Try adjusting the heat and cooking the pancakes until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set before flipping.\n3. Using old ingredients: Make sure your baking powder or baking soda is still fresh, as these leavening agents help the pancakes rise and become fluffy. If they're expired, your pancakes may be flat and dense.\n4. Wrong measurements: Double-check that you measured your ingredients correctly, especially the flour and milk. Too much flour can result in dry, tough pancakes, while too much milk can make them too thin and runny.\n\nIt's possible that one or more of these factors contributed to your pancakes turning out poorly.
