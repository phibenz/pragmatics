Here are a few possible reasons:\n\n1. **Overmixing the batter**: Overmixing can lead to tough, dense pancakes. The batter should be mixed just until the dry and wet ingredients are combined. It's okay if there are a few lumps.\n\n2. **Wrong heat setting**: If the heat is too high, the outside of the pancakes can burn before the inside is cooked through. Conversely, if the heat is too low, the pancakes can take too long to cook and may turn out dry or undercooked.\n\n3. **Incorrect measurements**: Baking is a science, and using too much or too little of an ingredient can significantly affect the outcome. For example, too much flour can make the pancakes dense, while too much baking powder can make them taste bitter.\n\n4. **Flipping too soon or too late**: Pancakes should be flipped when the edges look set and bubbles form and pop on the surface. Flipping too soon can result in pancakes that are raw in the middle, while flipping too late can lead to overcooked or burnt pancakes.\n\n5. **Old or improper ingredients**: Baking powder or baking soda that's past its prime won't help the pancakes rise properly. Similarly, using the wrong type of flour (like bread flour instead of all-purpose) can affect the texture.\n\nWithout more specific information, it's hard to say exactly what went wrong, but these are common issues that can lead to less-than-perfect pancakes.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "mistral-large-latest", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
