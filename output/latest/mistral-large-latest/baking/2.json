Overmixing the batter: If you stirred the batter until it was completely smooth, this might have developed the gluten in the flour too much, making the pancakes tough or rubbery. It's better to mix until just combined, with a few lumps remaining.\n\n2. Wrong heat level: If the heat was too high, the outside of the pancakes might have browned too quickly while the inside remained raw. If it was too low, the pancakes might have been cooked through but not browned properly.\n\n3. Using old baking powder or not enough: If your baking powder is old or you didn't use enough, the pancakes might not have risen properly and could be dense or flat.\n\n4. Not letting the batter rest: Letting the batter rest for a few minutes before cooking allows the flour to absorb the liquid and the baking powder to activate, which helps the pancakes to be tender and fluffy.\n\n5. Flipping too soon or too late: Flipping the pancakes at the wrong time can result in them being undercooked or burned. You should wait until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set before flipping.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "mistral-large-latest", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
