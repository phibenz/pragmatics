You might be referring to a different model or there might be a typo in the name. For instance, if you're referring to the LLaMA models from Meta, they have publicly disclosed models up to 65 billion parameters, not 70 billion.\n\nIf you're referring to a different model or there's a typo in the name, please provide the correct name, and I'll do my best to provide the information you're looking for. If you're referring to a specific model from a research paper or a blog post, please provide the link to it, and I can look at it to provide a more accurate answer.\n\nIn general, the hidden dimension (also known as the model dimension or the embedding size) of a transformer model is the dimensionality of the embeddings and the output vectors of each attention head and feedforward network in the model. It's usually denoted by $d\\_model$ in research papers and code implementations. It's one of the most important hyperparameters of a transformer model because it determines the capacity of the model and the amount of information that can flow through each layer.\n\nThe hidden dimension is usually chosen based on the size of the dataset and the computational resources available. Larger models with larger hidden dimensions tend to perform better on large datasets but require more computational resources to train and use. Smaller models with smaller hidden dimensions tend to perform worse on large datasets but require fewer computational resources.\n\nIn general, the hidden dimension is chosen to be a power of 2 because it makes the implementation of the model more efficient on modern hardware. For example, the original Transformer model from the \"Attention is All You Need\" paper had a hidden dimension of 512, and the BERT-Base model has a hidden dimension of 768.\n\nTo determine the hidden dimension of a specific model, you can look at the model's documentation, the research paper that introduced the model, or the code implementation of the model. If the hidden dimension is not explicitly stated, you can usually infer it from the shape of the weight matrices in the code or from the configuration file of the model.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "mistral-large-latest", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
