The graph is represented as a list of integer values, `lines_left` is the number of lines that need to be selected, and `distance_since_last` is the distance since the last line was selected. The function returns a tuple containing the minimum cost and the indices of the selected lines.\n\nThe function uses an LRU cache to store previously computed results, which improves performance by avoiding redundant calculations. The function has a base case that returns a large cost (1e9) and an empty list if the number of remaining lines is less than `lines_left`, or if both `lines_left` and the length of the graph are 0. The function considers two options: not taking the current line (option 1) and taking the current line (option 2). For option 1, the function checks if the distance since the last line was taken is less than 10 and recursively calls `solve_dp` with the remaining graph and an incremented `distance_since_last`. For option 2, the function takes the current line if `lines_left` is greater than 0, recursively calls `solve_dp` with the remaining graph and a decremented `lines_left`, and adds the cost of the current line plus the distance penalty to the subproblem cost.
