By default, Emacs displays the message \"Process <process-name> finished\" in the echo area.\n\nTo silence this message, you can set a custom process sentinel that doesn't display anything. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```elisp\n(defun my-python-process-sentinel (process event)\n  (unless (string= event \"finished\\n\")\n    (message \"Process %s %s\" process event)))\n\n(defun my-run-python-process ()\n  (let ((process (start-process \"python-process\" nil \"python\")))\n    (set-process-sentinel process #'my-python-process-sentinel)))\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n1. We define a custom process sentinel function called `my-python-process-sentinel`. This function takes two arguments: `process` (the process object) and `event` (a string describing the process event).\n\n2. Inside the `my-python-process-sentinel` function, we check if the `event` is equal to `\"finished\\n\"`. If it is, we do nothing and effectively silence the \"Process finished\" message. Otherwise, we display a message using the `message` function, showing the process name and the event.\n\n3. We define a function `my-run-python-process` that starts a Python process using `start-process`. It takes the process name (`\"python-process\"`) and the command (`\"python\"`) as arguments. The second argument `nil` specifies that we don't want to associate the process with any specific buffer.\n\n4. After starting the process, we use `set-process-sentinel` to set our custom sentinel function `my-python-process-sentinel` for the process.\n\nNow, whenever you call `(my-run-python-process)`, it will start a Python process, and when the process finishes, it will not display the default \"Process finished\" message in the echo area. However, if the process encounters any other event (e.g., an error), the custom sentinel will display a message with the process name and the event details.\n\nYou can modify the `my-python-process-sentinel` function to handle other events or perform additional actions as needed.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "claude-3-opus-20240229", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
