We include the `math.h` header to use the `fabs` function for calculating the absolute value of a floating-point number.\n\n2. The `my_sqrt` function takes two parameters: `number` (the number for which we want to calculate the square root) and `precision` (the desired precision of the result).\n\n3. We start with an initial guess by dividing `number` by 2. We use the `2.0f` literal to ensure floating-point division.\n\n4. We enter a loop that continues as long as the absolute difference between `guess * guess` and `number` is greater than or equal to the desired precision. We use the `fabs` function to calculate the absolute value.\n\n5. Inside the loop, we improve our guess using the Babylonian method. We calculate the average of the current guess and `number / guess`, which gives us a better approximation of the square root.\n\n6. Once the loop condition is no longer satisfied, we have found a sufficiently accurate approximation of the square root, and we return the final value of `guess`.\n\nNote: In C, we use the `float` data type for single-precision floating-point numbers.
