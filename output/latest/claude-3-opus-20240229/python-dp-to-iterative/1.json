The problem seems to be related to line breaks or text justification. Here's an explanation of what the code does:\n\n1. The function `solve_dp` takes three parameters:\n   - `graph`: A list representing the input graph or data.\n   - `lines_left`: The number of lines remaining to be selected.\n   - `distance_since_last`: The distance or cost accumulated since the last selected line.\n\n2. The function uses memoization with the `@lru_cache` decorator to store previously computed results and avoid redundant recursive calls.\n\n3. The base cases are handled as follows:\n   - If the number of elements in the graph is less than the number of lines left, it returns a large value (1e9) and an empty list, indicating an invalid solution.\n   - If there are no lines left and the graph is empty, it means a valid solution has been found, so it returns 0 and an empty list.\n\n4. The function considers two options:\n   - Option 1: Don't take the current line. If the `distance_since_last` is less than 10, it recursively calls `solve_dp` with the remaining graph (excluding the first element), the same number of lines left, and an incremented `distance_since_last`.\n   - Option 2: Take the current line. If there are lines left, it recursively calls `solve_dp` with the remaining graph, decremented `lines_left`, and a reset `distance_since_last`. It adds the current graph element and the squared difference of `distance_since_last` and 8 to the subproblem's cost. It also appends the current graph length to the solution list.\n\n5. The function returns the minimum cost and the corresponding solution list.\n\nNow, let's convert this recursive function to an iterative one:\n\n```python\ndef solve_iterative(graph, lines_left, distance_since_last):\n    n = len(graph)\n    dp = [[(1e9, []) for _ in range(lines_left + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = (0, [])\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(lines_left + 1):\n            # option 1: don't take the line\n            if distance_since_last < 10:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], (dp[i-1][j][0], dp[i-1][j][1]))\n\n            # option 2: take the line\n            if j > 0:\n                sub, how = dp[i-1][j-1]\n                sub += graph[i-1] + (distance_since_last - 8) ** 2\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], (sub, how + [n-i+1]))\n\n            distance_since_last += 1\n\n    return dp[n][lines_left]\n```\n\nIn the iterative version:\n\n1.

If there are lines left (`j > 0`), we calculate the cost and solution list by adding the current graph element and the squared difference of `distance_since_last` and 8 to the subproblem's cost.
