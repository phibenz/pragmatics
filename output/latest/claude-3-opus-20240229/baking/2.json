Leavening agents are crucial in pancake batter as they create bubbles and help the pancakes rise, resulting in a light and fluffy texture.\n\nWithout a leavening agent, your pancakes will likely be dense, flat, and may have a rubbery or chewy texture. To fix this issue, add about 1 to 2 teaspoons of baking powder to your dry ingredients, and mix well before adding the wet ingredients. This should help create much better pancakes.\n\nOther possible reasons for subpar pancakes include:\n1. Overmixing the batter, which can lead to tough, dense pancakes.\n2. Not letting the batter rest for a few minutes, which allows the gluten to relax and the leavening agent to activate.\n3. Cooking at the wrong temperature, either too low or too high.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, the lack of a leavening agent is the most likely culprit.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "claude-3-opus-20240229", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
