Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open FreeCAD and create a new document or open an existing one.\n\n2. Switch to the \"Sketcher\" workbench by selecting it from the workbench dropdown menu at the top of the FreeCAD window.\n\n3. Click on the \"Create a new sketch\" button in the Sketcher toolbar or go to \"Sketch\" > \"Create sketch\" from the top menu.\n\n4. Select a plane where you want to create the reference circle (e.g., XY plane).\n\n5. In the Sketcher toolbox, click on the \"Create circle\" button (it looks like a circle with a center point).\n\n6. Click in the sketching area to place the center point of the circle, and then click again to set the radius of the circle.\n\n7. Right-click on the circle in the Sketcher view and select \"Toggle construction\" from the context menu. This will change the circle's appearance to a dashed line, indicating that it is a construction geometry and will not be part of the final model.\n\nNow you have a reference circle that you can use to create your hexagon:\n\n1. Use the \"Create line\" tool to draw lines that start and end on the reference circle. Snap the starting and ending points of the lines to the intersection points on the circle.\n\n2. Create six lines to form the hexagon shape, ensuring that each line starts and ends on the reference circle.\n\n3. Once you have created the hexagon, you can exit the Sketcher workbench by clicking the \"Close\" button in the Sketcher toolbox or by pressing the \"Esc\" key.\n\nThe reference circle will not be part of the final geometry, but it will still be visible as a construction line to help you create and align other shapes.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "claude-3-opus-20240229", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
