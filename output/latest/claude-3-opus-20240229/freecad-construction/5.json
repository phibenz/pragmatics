Switch to the \"Sketcher\" workbench by clicking on it in the workbench dropdown menu or by using the keyboard shortcut \"Ctrl+R\" and selecting \"Sketcher\".\n\n3. Click on the \"Create a new sketch\" button in the Sketcher toolbar or go to \"Sketch\" > \"Create sketch\" in the top menu.\n\n4. Select the plane where you want to create the reference circle (e.g., XY plane, XZ plane, or YZ plane) and click \"OK\".\n\n5. In the Sketcher workbench, click on the \"Create circle\" tool in the toolbar or go to \"Sketch\" > \"Geometries\" > \"Create circle\".\n\n6. Click on the origin point (0,0) or any other point where you want to place the center of the reference circle.\n\n7. Click again to set the radius of the circle or enter the desired radius value in the \"Constraints\" tab of the Combo View.\n\n8.

This will change the circle's appearance to a dashed line, indicating that it is a reference geometry and not part of the final shape.\n\n9. Now you can use the reference circle as a guide to draw your hexagon. You can create lines or other shapes and use the reference circle to align them precisely.\n\n10. Once you have finished drawing your hexagon or other shapes, you can hide the reference circle by right-clicking on it and selecting \"Hide\" from the context menu, or you can delete it if it's no longer needed.\n\nBy using a reference circle, you can ensure that your hexagon or other shapes are accurately aligned and sized according to your requirements.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "claude-3-opus-20240229", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
