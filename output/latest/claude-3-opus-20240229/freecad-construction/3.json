Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open FreeCAD and switch to the \"Draft\" workbench by selecting it from the workbench dropdown menu or using the workbench selector.\n\n2. Click on the \"Circle\" tool in the Draft toolbar or select \"Draft\" > \"Circle\" from the menu.\n\n3. In the \"Tasks\" panel that appears on the left side of the screen, you'll see options for creating the circle.\n\n4. Enter the desired radius for your reference circle in the \"Radius\" field.\n\n5. Choose the center point of the circle by clicking on a point in the 3D view or entering coordinates in the \"Center\" fields.\n\n6. In the \"Filled\" dropdown menu, select \"None\" to create a non-filled circle that will only serve as a reference.\n\n7. Click the \"OK\" button to create the reference circle.\n\nNow you have a reference circle that you can use to align other objects or create shapes like a hexagon. To create a hexagon using the reference circle:\n\n1. Use the \"Line\" or \"Wire\" tool to create straight lines by snapping to the points on the reference circle. You can hold down the \"Ctrl\" key while moving the mouse to enable snapping.\n\n2. Create six lines or segments, each starting and ending at the intersection points of the reference circle, to form a hexagon shape.\n\n3. If desired, you can use the \"Trim\" or \"Extend\" tools to clean up the edges of the hexagon.\n\n4. Once you have the hexagon shape, you can hide or delete the reference circle if it's no longer needed.\n\nBy using a reference circle, you can easily align and create precise shapes like hexagons in FreeCAD's Draft workbench.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "claude-3-opus-20240229", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
