In the Sketcher workbench, click on the \"Create circle\" tool from the toolbar or go to Sketch > Sketcher geometries > Create circle.\n\n3. Click in the sketch area to place the center point of the circle, and then click again to define the radius of the circle.\n\n4.

For example, to create a hexagon:\n   - Create six lines by clicking on the \"Create line\" tool and clicking on the circumference of the reference circle at equal intervals.\n   - Use the \"Create coincident constraint\" tool to make sure each line starts and ends on the circumference of the reference circle.\n   - Optionally, you can add additional constraints like equal length or parallel constraints to ensure the hexagon is regular.\n\n6. Once you have created the hexagon or any other desired shape using the reference circle, you can exit the sketch.\n\nThe reference circle will not be part of the final geometry, but it will have served its purpose as a guide for aligning other elements in your sketch.\n\nRemember to toggle off the construction mode for the lines that you want to be part of the final shape, as construction mode elements are not included in the final geometry when you exit the sketch.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "claude-3-opus-20240229", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
