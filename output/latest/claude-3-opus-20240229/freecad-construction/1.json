Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open FreeCAD and create a new document or open an existing one.\n\n2. Switch to the \"Sketcher\" workbench by clicking on it in the workbench dropdown menu or using the keyboard shortcut \"Ctrl+R\" and selecting \"Sketcher\".\n\n3.

In the Sketcher workbench, click on the \"Create circle\" button in the Sketcher geometries toolbar or go to \"Sketch\" -> \"Sketcher geometries\" -> \"Create circle\".\n\n5. Click and drag in the sketch area to create a circle of the desired size.\n\n6. With the circle selected, go to the \"Constraints\" toolbar and click on the \"Construction mode\" button (it looks like a blue triangle with a small white square inside).

You can now use the construction circle as a reference to create your hexagon or align other lines and shapes.\n\n   - To create a hexagon, you can use the \"Create regular polygon\" tool in the Sketcher geometries toolbar. Click on the tool, then click the center of the construction circle, and drag outwards to create a hexagon inscribed in the circle.\n\n   - To align lines with the circle, you can use the \"Create line\" tool and snap the endpoints to the intersection points between the circle and other geometry.\n\n8. Once you have created your desired geometry using the construction circle as a reference, you can exit the Sketcher workbench by clicking the \"Close\" button or pressing \"Esc\".\n\nThe construction circle will not be part of the final geometry, but it will remain visible as a reference in the sketch.
