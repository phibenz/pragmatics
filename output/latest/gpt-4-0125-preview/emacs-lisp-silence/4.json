Here's an approach to do so:\n\n1. **Create a dedicated buffer for process output**: This can be any buffer, potentially one you create just for catching the process output and messages.\n\n2. **Start the process with output redirected to your buffer**: When starting the process, specify your buffer as the destination for the process's output and messages.\n\nHere's an example that demonstrates these steps:\n\n```emacs-lisp\n(defun run-python-process-silently ()\n  \"Run a python process silently, without showing the termination message.\"\n  (let* ((process-buffer (get-buffer-create \"*Silent Python Process*\")) ;; Step 1\n         (process (start-process \"python-process\" process-buffer \"python\" \"-c\" \"print('Hello, World!')\")))\n    (set-process-query-on-exit-flag process nil) ;; Optional: Prevent \"kill process?\" query on Emacs exit.\n    ))\n```\n\nIn this example, a Python process is started with its output directed to a buffer named `*Silent Python Process*`. The `set-process-query-on-exit-flag` line is optional and is used here to prevent Emacs from asking whether to kill the process when Emacs is being closed. This line isn't strictly necessary for silencing the process but can be helpful in managing process cleanup silently.\n\nRemember, this approach doesn't \"silence\" the termination message in the strictest sense\u2014it merely diverts it to a different buffer. If you need to check the process's output or status, you can still switch to `*Silent Python Process*` to see what happened. This method is practical for keeping your main Emacs interface clean from such messages.\n\nAnother approach, if you're specifically looking to suppress only the termination message and not all output, involves more intricate process management, including potentially advising or overriding the default process sentinel (which handles process termination messages).
