This is typically helpful for interactive use, but it can be distracting or undesirable in some scripts or functions.\n\nTo silence the \"Process xyz finished\" messages for a process, you can use the `set-process-sentinel` function to set a custom sentinel (a callback function) for your process. A sentinel is called whenever the state of the process changes, such as when the process finishes. By providing a custom sentinel that does not display a message, you can effectively silence these automatic notifications.\n\nHere's a simple example of how to start a Python process and silence the \"Process python-process finished\" message by setting a custom sentinel:\n\n```lisp\n(defun my-silent-python-process-sentinel (process event)\n  \"A sentinel for Python processes that silences the finished message.\"\n  ;; Here we're purposefully ignoring the `event` string.\n  ;; You can customize this function to handle different events if needed.\n  )\n\n(let ((process (start-process \"python-process\" \"*Python Output*\" \"python\" \"-c\" \"print('Hello, world!')\")))\n  (set-process-sentinel process #'my-silent-python-process-sentinel))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- A Python process is started using `start-process`, which executes a simple Python command to print \"Hello, world!\".\n- We define a sentinel function `my-silent-python-process-sentinel` that takes two arguments: the process and the event string describing what happened to the process. This function does nothing, effectively silencing any automatic messages about the process finishing.\n- We use `set-process-sentinel` to attach our custom sentinel to the Python process.\n\nRemember, the sentinel is a powerful tool. If you need your program to react to the process in some way when it finishes (e.g., cleaning up resources, updating the UI), you should implement that logic within your custom sentinel function. The example above is the most basic version, designed solely to suppress the finished message.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
