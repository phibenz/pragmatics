A process sentinel is a function that is called when the process changes state, such as finishing or exiting.\n\nBy default, Emacs may display messages when a process exits or finishes, which can be distracting or undesirable in some cases. To silence these messages, you can set a custom sentinel that does nothing (or does something else without displaying a message) when the process finishes.\n\nHere's an example of how you might start a Python process and set a custom sentinel to silence the \"Process python-process finished\" message:\n\n```emacs-lisp\n(defun my-python-process-sentinel (process event)\n  \"Silent sentinel for a Python process. Ignores the EVENT.\"\n  ;; Here you can do something with the process if needed.\n  ;; The message function is commented out to silence the default message.\n  ;; (message \"Process: %s had the event `%s'\" process event)\n  )\n\n(let ((process (start-process \"python-process\" \"*Python Output*\" \"python\" \"-c\" \"print('Hello, world!')\")))\n  (set-process-sentinel process 'my-python-process-sentinel))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We define a custom sentinel function `my-python-process-sentinel` that takes a `process` and an `event` as arguments. This function is designed to do nothing (or whatever you want that doesn't involve displaying a message) when called, thus effectively silencing the completion message.\n- We then start a Python process using `start-process` that runs a simple Python command. The process is named \"python-process\", and its output goes to a buffer named \"*Python Output*\".\n- Lastly, we use `set-process-sentinel` to set the `my-python-process-sentinel` function as the sentinel for our Python process. This means that when the Python process changes state (e.g., finishes), `my-python-process-sentinel` will be called instead of the default behavior, silencing the \"Process python-process finished\" message.\n\nRemember, if you do want to perform some action when the process finishes, you can add your code to the custom sentinel function. Just ensure that any messages or dialogues that you don't want to display are commented out or removed.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
