This step might not be necessary depending on the final sorting criteria, but it's kept here for clarity and to handle potential secondary sorting.\n\n4. The `awk` command processes each line, calculating the least significant digit of the size (`size%10`), and prints this digit followed by the original line.\n\n5. `sort -n -k1,1`: Sorts the output numerically (`-n`) based on the first column, which is the least significant digit calculated earlier.\n\n6. `cut -d ' ' -f2-`: Cuts out the first field (the least significant digit used for sorting), leaving just the file names.\n\n7. `sed 's|./||'`: Cleans up the file names by removing the leading `./` part.\n\nThis script will output the filenames in the directory `/tmp/pragmatics/bash-file-size-mod/`, sorted according to the least significant digit of their sizes, as requested.
