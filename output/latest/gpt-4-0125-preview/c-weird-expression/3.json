This expression contains a mix of unary operators, which makes it look complex at first glance. However, we can simplify it by understanding the precedence and associativity of each operator involved.\n\nOperators involved:\n- `*` (dereference)\n- `++` (prefix increment)\n- `--` (postfix decrement)\n- `~` (bitwise NOT)\n- `-` (unary minus)\n\nOperator precedence (from highest to lowest):\n1. Postfix increment/decrement (`x++`, `x--`)\n2. Prefix increment/decrement (`++x`, `--x`), and unary operators such as `*` (dereference), `~` (bitwise NOT), and unary minus (`-`)\n\nConsidering the precedence and right-to-left associativity for the same precedence level (for unary operators), the expression can be dissected as follows:\n\nGiven:\n```\n-~++*x--\n```\n\nLet's ignore the side effects as instructed and focus purely on the evaluation:\n\n1. `x--` is postfix decrement, but since we are ignoring side effects, consider it as `*x` for evaluation.\n2. `*x` dereferences `x`.\n3. `++*x` increments the dereferenced value of `x`. However, we're ignoring side effects, so this can be considered as just affecting the value for the operation, not the actual value of `*x`.\n4. `~` then takes the bitwise NOT of the result from step 3.\n5.

Therefore, in simplest form considering an abstract value `n` that `*x` would represent, the operation is equivalent to:\n\n```\n-negate(bitwise NOT(increment(n)))\n```\n\nSince the increment is `n + 1`, the bitwise NOT operation `~n` is equivalent to `-n - 1` for any integer `n` (due to how two's complement representation works for negative numbers).
