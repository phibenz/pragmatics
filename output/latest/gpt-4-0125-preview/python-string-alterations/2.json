However, since you've asked for a custom function named `alter`, I'll show you how to implement it from scratch. This function will generate all unique permutations of the given string `x` and return them as a list of strings.\n\n```python\ndef alter(x):\n    # Base case: if x is empty or a single character, only one permutation is possible\n    if len(x) <= 1:\n        return [x]\n    \n    # List to store all unique permutations\n    permutations = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the string and recursively find permutations of the remainder of the string\n    for i, char in enumerate(x):\n        # Avoid duplicating permutations when the character is repeated\n        if char not in x[:i]:\n            # For each character, find all permutations of the rest of the string\n            for p in alter(x[:i] + x[i+1:]):\n                # Concatenate the current character with permutations of the rest of the string\n                permutations.append(char + p)\n    \n    return permutations\n\n# Example usage\nx = \"abc\"\nprint(alter(x))\n```\n\nThis function works by choosing each character in the input string `x` as the starting character and then finding all permutations of the remaining characters. It does this recursively until the base case (a string of length 0 or 1) is reached. To ensure unique permutations, it checks if a character has already been used as the starting character at the current recursive level before proceeding.\n\nKeep in mind that the number of permutations grows factorially with the length of the string, so this can become very slow for larger strings. Also, the function avoids generating duplicate permutations by checking if a character has already been considered at the current position (`if char not in x[:i]`), which is particularly useful for strings containing repeated characters.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
