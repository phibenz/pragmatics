Construction geometry in FreeCAD is essentially a way to create reference shapes or lines that don't contribute to the actual geometry but assist in sketching and constraining your design. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open a Sketch**: First, you need to have a sketch open. You can do this by creating a new document, then clicking on the 'Sketcher Workbench' icon. After that, click on 'Create a new sketch' and choose the plane you want to sketch on.\n\n2. **Draw a Circle**: With the Sketcher workbench active, click on the circle tool (or press 'C' on your keyboard). Click on the origin point or anywhere on your sketch plane to place the center of the circle, then drag outward to define the radius of your circle, and click again to set it.\n\n3. **Convert to Construction Geometry**: Now, with the circle still selected (it will be highlighted in yellow if it is selected), look for the \"Construction Mode\" button in the toolbar. It's represented by a blue and white striped square. Clicking this button will convert the circle from regular geometry (solid line) to construction geometry (dashed line). If you can't find the button, you can also switch to construction mode before drawing the circle; any geometry created while in construction mode will automatically be construction geometry.\n\n4. **Use the Circle as Reference**: Now that you have your construction circle, you can use it as a reference to line up the points of your hexagon. You might want to use the 'Polygon' tool to create your hexagon. Make sure to switch off the construction mode by clicking the \"Construction Mode\" button again if you want your hexagon to be part of the solid geometry.\n\n5. **Constrain Your Hexagon**: Use geometric constraints (like 'Coincident') to place the vertices of your hexagon on the construction circle. This will ensure your hexagon is perfectly aligned with the circle.\n\n6. **Finish**: Once you've aligned and constrained your hexagon (or any other geometry) using the construction circle as a reference, you can continue sketching or finish the sketch if you're done.\n\nRemember, construction geometry is not included when you pad or pocket the sketch. It's purely for reference, which makes it perfect for your use case of aligning elements without adding the circle to the final model.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
