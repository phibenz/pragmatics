Construction geometry is used only for reference purposes and does not create solid geometry. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open FreeCAD and start a new project** if you haven't already done so.\n\n2. **Switch to the Sketcher Workbench**: You can do this by selecting it from the dropdown menu in the upper left corner of the FreeCAD window.\n\n3. **Create a new sketch**: Click on the 'Create a new sketch' button or choose `Sketch` > `New Sketch` from the menu. Choose the plane you want to sketch on (XY, XZ, or YZ) and click OK.\n\n4. **Draw a circle**: Use the Circle tool from the toolbar (or press 'C' on your keyboard) to draw a circle in your sketch. Don't worry about the circle's size for now; you can adjust it later.\n\n5. **Switch to Construction Mode**: Before drawing the circle or after selecting the circle you've drawn, click the `Toggle construction mode` button in the toolbar (it looks like a white and blue dashed square). This will change the circle's appearance to dashed lines, indicating it is now construction geometry.\n\n6. **Use the circle as a reference to draw your hexagon**: You can now use the Snap tools (like snap to center or snap to point) to precisely draw lines or other shapes in relation to the construction circle. To draw a hexagon, you might want to place points on the circle where the vertices of the hexagon should be and then connect these points with lines.\n\n   - **To place points on the circle:** Use the 'Point' tool in construction mode and place them where you want the hexagon corners. Make sure the points snap to the circle's perimeter.\n   - **To draw the hexagon:** Switch off the 'Toggle construction mode' and use the 'Line' tool to connect the points you've placed on the circle.\n\n7. **Adjust dimensions as needed**: You can set the exact dimensions for your hexagon sides or the radius of the reference circle using the Constraints tools (like distance, radius, or angle constraints).\n\n8. **Finish the sketch**: Once you're satisfied with your hexagon, click 'Close the editing of the sketch' to finish.\n\nRemember, the construction geometry (the circle, in this case) will not be part of the solid model you create from the sketch. It only serves as a guide for drawing and constraining the elements that will form part of the model. This method is very useful for creating complex sketches based on geometric relations and references.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
