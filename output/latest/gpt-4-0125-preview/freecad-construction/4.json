Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open FreeCAD** and choose the workbench relevant to your task. For sketch-based modeling, you'll typically use the \"Part Design\" or \"Sketcher\" workbench.\n\n2. **Start a New Sketch**: Go to the \"Part Design\" or \"Sketcher\" workbench, select a plane to sketch on, and then click the \"Create a new sketch\" button.\n\n3. **Enable Construction Mode**: Inside the sketcher, you'll see a toolbar at the top or left-hand side. Look for a button with a blue and white icon that resembles a geometric construction (usually a triangle and circle). This is the \"Toggle construction geometry\" button. Click it to enable Construction Mode. You'll know it's active because the button will appear pressed or highlighted.\n\n4. **Draw the Circle**: With Construction Mode active, select the circle drawing tool from the toolbar and draw your circle on the sketch plane. This circle will now be in construction mode, indicated by its dashed or different appearance, signifying that it's for reference only and won't be part of the solid model.\n\n5. **Use the Circle for Reference**: Now, you can use this construction circle to guide the placement of your other sketch elements, such as the vertices of your hexagon. The sketch's snapping features will help you align these points precisely to the circle's circumference.\n\n6. **Draw the Hexagon**: Switch off the Construction Mode by clicking the \"Toggle construction geometry\" button again, ensuring you're back to creating normal geometry. Then, proceed to draw your hexagon or any other shape, using the reference circle to align or position the vertices accurately.\n\n7. **Finish the Sketch**: Once your hexagon (or other desired geometry) is complete, and you're satisfied with the sketch, you can finish the sketch by clicking the \"Close the editing of the sketch\" button.\n\nRemember, the construction geometry circle will not affect the final model; it's only there to aid in sketching the shapes accurately according to your design intent. This feature is very useful for complex sketches where precise alignment or positioning is crucial.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
