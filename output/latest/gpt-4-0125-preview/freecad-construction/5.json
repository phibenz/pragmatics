Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Open FreeCAD and Select the Sketcher Workbench:**\n   - Start FreeCAD and from the Workbench selector, choose the \"Sketcher\" workbench.\n\n2. **Create a New Sketch:**\n   - Click on `Create a new sketch` or go to the `Sketch` menu and select `New sketch`.\n   - Choose the plane you want to work on (XY plane, XZ plane, or YZ plane) and click OK.\n\n3. **Enable Construction Mode:**\n   - In the Sketcher workbench, you will find an option to toggle the construction mode. This is generally represented by an icon that looks like two overlapping triangles (one solid and one outlined) or it may be a button labeled \"Construction\" or \"Construction Mode\" in the toolbar.\n   - Click on this icon to enable the Construction mode. Any geometry you create while this mode is active will be used for reference only and won't be part of the solid geometry you might extrude later.\n\n4. **Draw the Reference Circle:**\n   - With the Construction mode activated, select the Circle tool from the toolbar (or use the shortcut, usually by pressing the \"C\" key).\n   - Click on the sketch to define the center of the circle and then move the mouse to define the radius. Click again to finalize the circle.\n   - This circle is now a construction geometry, indicated by its appearance (usually dashed lines), and it will serve as a reference for your actual geometry.\n\n5. **Drawing the Hexagon:**\n   - To draw a hexagon aligned to the reference circle, you will need to switch back to the normal mode (deactivate the Construction mode by clicking the same button again).\n   - Use the \"Polyline\" tool or \"Line\" tool to draw the edges of the hexagon. You can snap to the reference circle's perimeter to ensure the vertices of the hexagon are correctly placed. Remember, the angles between each side of a regular hexagon are 60 degrees.\n\n6. **Final Adjustments:**\n   - Make any necessary adjustments to your sketch. You can use constraints and dimensions to ensure your hexagon has equal sides and is properly aligned with the reference circle.\n   - Once satisfied, you can exit the Sketcher workbench and use your sketch to create 3D geometry if needed.\n\nThis method allows you to use the reference circle as a guide without it becoming part of the final solid geometry, perfect for aligning other elements or for geometric constructions within your design process.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
