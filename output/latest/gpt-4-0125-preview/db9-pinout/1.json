This connector is designed to support the SuperSpeed data transfer mode of USB 3.0. The USB 3.0 Micro-B connector is distinct from the more common Micro-USB (USB 2.0) connectors, as it has an additional set of pins beside the standard Micro-USB pin arrangement to handle the increased data transfer speed. This is why it has a wider appearance with one side featuring 5 pins (the SuperSpeed contacts) and the other side featuring the standard Micro-USB configuration of 4 pins. This type of connector is often found on external hard drives and some high-end smartphones and tablets from the early 2010s.", "success": true, "error": null, "args": {"model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "api_key": "api-key-redacted"}}
