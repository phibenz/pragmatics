This specific error is indicative of a problem with serializing (pickling) objects for inter-process communication. The multiprocessing module in Python uses pickling to pass objects between the main process and child processes, and not all objects can be pickled easily, especially those that are tied to external resources or system states, such as open files or network connections.\n\nIn your case, the error likely stems from the `client.audio.speech.create` call in the `create_speech_file` function. The objects returned by the OpenAI SDK, specifically the response from `client.audio.speech.create`, are probably not easily serializable due to their complex structure and internal references to network connections or other resources.\n\nTo work around this issue, you should consider modifying your design to ensure that only serializable objects (e.g., simple data types like strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries that do not contain complex objects) are passed between processes. Here's an alternative approach:\n\n1. Instead of streaming the response directly to a file within the `create_speech_file` function and then returning a potentially complex, non-serializable object, consider saving the speech audio data to a file within this function and then returning the filename (a string, which is easily serializable) to the main process.\n\n2.
