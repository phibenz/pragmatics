The `document.documentElement` represents the `<html>` element, and `outerHTML` gives you the HTML content of the element, including its own markup.\n\n4. **Copy the HTML**: After executing the above command, the entire HTML will be printed in the console. You might need to right-click on the output and select \"Copy\" to copy the entire HTML.

This will create a local copy of the page as it currently appears in your browser.\n\nRemember, this method captures the current state of the DOM as rendered and possibly modified by JavaScript, not necessarily the original source HTML file.
