When the file is split into chunks, a word could potentially be split across two chunks.

This adjustment is made without a corresponding adjustment at the end of the previous chunk, meaning that if a word is split across the boundary, the beginning part of the word in the end of the previous chunk might not be counted, while the latter part in the next chunk is trimmed off and not counted either, leading to potential undercounting.\n\nThe code's intention to avoid cutting words in half and its strategy for dealing with this issue is understandable, but the implementation might not fully resolve the potential for inaccurately counting words that span chunk boundaries.
