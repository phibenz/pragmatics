Specifically, the issue arises from attempting to read a portion of the file using `f.read(end - start)` without considering that this might cut a word in half at the boundary of the chunk. The code attempts to address this by reading the remainder of the word after the chunk ends with `remainder = f.readline()`. However, the problem lies in the fact that when the `f.seek(end)` is called, if `end` falls in the middle of a word, `f.readline()` will complete the current line instead of just completing the current word. This means that additional words that are not part of the designated chunk can be included in the word count, leading to inaccurate results.\n\nTo fix this issue, a more precise method of ensuring that words are not split at the boundaries of the chunks is needed. One approach could be to read slightly past the end of each chunk, just enough to complete any word that might have been cut off, and then carefully handling the overlap between chunks to ensure words are not counted more than once.
